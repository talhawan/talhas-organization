Many people feel helpless when they are confronted with a problem they can't resolve- and you might not be able to directly help, but even small contributions to nonprofits can help them live a better life.</td>
            <td class="textMid"> Supporting nonprofits and helping people in need can boost your confidence. Volunteers benefit from interacting with people from different walks of life on  a regular basis. People who donate see the fruit of their labor used in a positive manner and spent on a worthy cause. This can make you feel better about yourself.</td>
            <td class="textRight">Sometimes giving it forward can pay you back. Supporting nonprofits means supporting the community. You never know when you might need the community's help in the future. This relationship of give-and-take uplifts everyone and makes life a little better.</td>
